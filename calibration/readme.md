## Calibration Resources

Science Jubilee relies on various calibration routines to be set up. This has been done in advance for the machines at the workshop, but these notebooks might be useful if you find yourself needing to add a new tool/redo some calibration/etc!

- **LabAutomationDeckCalibration:** Make a new deck calibration file. Use this if you need to add a deck to your machine, or if your deck becomes misaligned for whatever reason
- **SetToolParkingPositions:** Sets the XY position for a newly installed tool. Use this if you're adding/chaning a tool on your machine. 
- **ToolAlignmentXY:** Set XY offsets so that a newly installed tool's tip is aligned to relative to all other tools. Run this after you set the parking positions.
