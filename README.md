# Pathways to Open-Source Hardware for Laboratory Automation Workshop
On April 14-15 2025, we are gathering a group of scientists and engineers interested in using open-source technologies for automating scientific experiments at the University of Washington! Over the workshop, we will have 4 'hackathon' sessions to test/prototype/experiment with Jubilees for laboratory automation. You can find more information [here](https://depts.washington.edu/machines/scienceautomation/).

This repostitory contains resources to control a Jubilee using Python!

## Setup
We will have 6 Jubilees set up for use (this should work out to 3-4 people per Jubilee). We will provide laptops with the latest verson of [science-jubilee](https://science-jubilee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed.
If for any reason you'd like to install software on your personal computer, or just learn more about the software, please check out the documentation!

## Tool Library
We will have the following tools available to use on the machine during the workshop:
- Opentrons OT-2 Pipette
- 10cc syringe
- Webcam tool
- Simple spectrometer
- Laboratory automation deck
